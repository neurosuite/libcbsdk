libcbsdk
========

A C++ library that allows you to interact with Blackrock Microsystems neural signal processing hardware.

This is a fork of [CereLink](https://github.com/dashesy/CereLink) turned it into a standalone C++ library, similar to the CBSDK that comes with Central, without the Matlab dependency, but with Qt5 support and proper CMake package files.

In theory the library should be 100% compatible with any code that previously worked with the *official* CBSDK as long as it only uses the ```cbSdk...``` functions.
